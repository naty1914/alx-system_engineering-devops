attack_is_the_best_defense

This README explores the concept of "Attack is the Best Defense" in the context of network sniffing, ARP spoofing, Docker, and dictionary assaults.

Network Sniffing: is the process of collecting and analyzing network traffic. It aids in troubleshooting, network security analysis, and monitoring network activities.

ARP Spoofing: is a technique for manipulating a network device's ARP cache. It enables attackers to redirect network communication destined for another device, resulting in eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.

Docker: is an open-source platform for container-based application development, deployment, and management. Containers bundle applications and their dependencies, resulting in a consistent and portable environment across multiple computer platforms.


Dictionary attack: is a way of gaining unauthorized access by repeatedly entering passwords from a dictionary or prepared list. It takes advantage of weak passwords that many people use.
