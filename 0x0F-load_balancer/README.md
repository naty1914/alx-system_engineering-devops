0x0F-load_balancer

A load balancer functions as a middleman between clients and servers, distributing incoming network traffic evenly across numerous servers.
It aids in evenly distributing the workload across servers, guaranteeing effective resource use and prevents any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

Load Balancing Algorithms:  techniques used to distribute traffic across servers, such as round-robin, least connections, IP Hash, etc.

High Availability: utilizing redundancy and failover measures to make sure the load balancer itself doesn't turn into a single point of failure.
